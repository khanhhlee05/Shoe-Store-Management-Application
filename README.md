# Shoe-Store-Management-Application
This is my IB Computer Science Internal Assessment, where I used JAVA and NetBeans IDE to create a shoe store application for my client that allow the user to manage and control the information of their store, including the orders that have been made and the products available in the store.
This project utilizes JAVA Object Oriented Programming and intergrates with SQLite database for centralized data storage.
I believe this project is abstract and have a lot of potential to grow, not only for shoe store but also for other kinds of products with a few modifications.
GRADE: 28/34

TO RUN THE PROJECT:
Compile the file MAIN.java in the src folder in any Java IDE after you clone this project. From there feel free to discover different feature of the application.

Code Annotation is provide in every Java file.
